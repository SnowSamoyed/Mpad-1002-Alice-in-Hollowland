          <p>unsure of what twisted secrets lurked in the shadows or what grotesque specters might rise from the depths of this eerie ocean of decay.</p>

          <p>The silence pressed upon her like an oppressive force, it was far from an absence of events. </p>
          <p>It was a deceptive calm. Every step Alice took sent unsettling echoes through the decaying remnants of twisted vegetation,</p>
          <p> and almost as if in reply, this time echoed back another faint rattle, yet again suppressing itself before long. </p>
          <p>This time seemingly closer, or perhaps just an effect of Alice’s paranoia.</p>

          <p> Rhythmic with her pacing distant rattles persisted every now and then, each one sending a stronger shiver down her spine. </p>
          <p>Still unsure if it was the echo of her own fear or a malevolent presence drawing nearer, she quickened her pace, only to be met with another rattle,</p>
          <p> unmistakably closer this time. Each step Alice took was now accompanied by the haunting percussion of her unseen pursuer. Panic clawing at her mind. </p>

          <p>Suspecting the tea to be a poison, Alice hesitated, her gaze darting between the contents of her cup and the Mad Hatter.</p>
          <p>She knew she needed whatever it was that lay within this twisted gathering, but she also knew that the Mad Hatter would not relinquish it easily, nor did she know what it was that she was to be looking for.</p>
          <p>This hesitation irritated the Mad Hatter, and he began to press Alice to drink, his demeanor shifting eccentricity. His body pushed itself further over the table. Leaning in everso closer to Alice.</p>

          <p>It was apparent the position he was in was one of discomfort, he looked as if he was a cat ready to pounce as he loomed unnaturally. </p>
          <p class="madHatter-line"> "Nonsense, my dear. You must drink," </p>

          <p>The Cheshire cat seemed to be at a loss of words for a moment. He knew not what to say and Alice’s shouting had seemed to startle him. In an attempt to keep his composure he made a stark remark to evade Alice’s question.</p>

          <p>He reassures her as he leads Alice along through the woods. </p>
          <p>Yet again, Alice observes a change in surroundings as they exit from underneath the forest's canopy. Before them lies a vast field of minty green grass, and a cloudy grey sky diffusing the light attempting to pass through it. </p>

        <section id="novel-text" class="flowInText">
          <p>Across the field rests a great stone wall and within it a large metal gate held shut by a lock, and towering behind all of that in the distance a massive castle with pointed roofing.
            Alice remarks that everything looks in order from here on out. There’s a sense of organization in the observed setting.</p>
          <p>Upon their clearing of the long field and arrival at the gate, Alice uses the key she’d claimed from the teaparty to unlock it and progress, gaining access to the Queen of spades’s courtyard where they are met with a grand garden. </p>
          <p>Making they’re way to the castle however, would not be such a walk in the park. Firstly, they had to navigate through a massive labyrinth of hedge to clear the gap between them and the castle doors.</p>

          <p>Cheshire cat replied while walking off.</p>
          <p>It was then that the Cheshire cat had jauntily slipped into the hedge and climbed his way up to its top. Flaunting the perks of his cat-like physique.</p>
          <p><span class="cheshire-line">“You see my dear, there is no need to worry the Cheshire cat shall guide you from atop the maze.”</span> he gushed.</p>

          <p>“Good choice.” The guard mutters as he opens the door allowing Alice to finally pass.

          <p>Within this small room lies a detailed chest resting on a wooden table.</p>
          <p>Opening it reveals an ancient looking curved dagger far older than the kingdom of which it was being kept in, decorated with various engravings.</p>
          <p>Perhaps meant to symbolize something. Its hilt resembles that of a serpent, with a clear gemstone lodged into its guard. It does not appear to fit in with the rest of the Kingdom of spades.</p>

          <p>After Alice receives the blade from the White Queen, she is taken to a window in the White Queen’s chambers that overlooks the Red Kingdom far in the distance.</p>
          <p>The queen then led Alice to a window overseeing the Red Kingdom of Hearts in the horizon. </p>
          <p><span class="whiteQueen-line">"You see, Alice,"</span> she began, her tone gentle yet resolute, <span class="whiteQueen-line">"this is the realm that has fallen under the oppressive rule of the Red Queen. It is a land plagued by fear, suffering, and injustice."</span></p>
          <p>Alice’s eyes remained fixated on the horizon, with determination in mind. One final task was to be completed before she could at last go home.</p>

          <p>Alice who was once naive was now filled with resolve. She clutched the gemstone blade tight in her hands. It was her symbol of home, and a weapon of freedom to the inhabitants of wonderland.</p>
          <p>With a solemn nod, the White Queen gestured for Alice to follow her as she led the way out of the chambers and into the corridors of the palace.</p>
          <p><span class="whiteQueen-line">“Go on now dear, I will meet you when the deed is done.”</span> She says, closing the door behind Alice as she exits the royal chambers.</p>

          <p>As they embarked towards the glowing red horizon, Alice felt the weight of her determination settle deep within her. With every step, she readied herself for the grand finale that awaited her; a confrontation with the root of evil. </p>
          <p>Together, they marched towards the crimson skyline, where the fate of Wonderland hung, and where Alice's courage would need to shine brightest to cast away the darkness.</p>

          <p>Finally, standing face to face with the defenseless tyrant, Alice drove the gemstone blade deep into the Red Queen's heart, a decisive blow that marked the end of her reign of terror. Her fate finally sealed.</p>

          <p>Shortly thereafter the White Queen on Spades had arrived as promised. Alice’s hope had arrived to deliver.  She commended Alice for her bravery from across the yard, but her demeanor suddenly shifted when she demanded the return of the knife.</p>
          <p>Just as Alice was about to walk over to fulfill her purpose a certain feline intervened. His presence sent the queen into utter distress. His horribly wrong grin plastered across his face imposing on her motives.</p>
