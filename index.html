          <p>Its heavy, static, and despairing presence made it indistinguishable whether it was dusk or dawn,</p>

          <p>further adding to Alice’s disorientation and demorale.</p>

          <p>Biting her nails, Alice reluctantly rose from the cold, damp ground. </p>

          <p>Her surroundings cloaked in an unyielding expanse of decay. She’d start to wander through the spanning ocean of rot. In silence; adding to her feeling of paranoia.</p>

          <p>Alice, unable to shake off the lingering feeling of being watched, moved cautiously through this nightmarish realm, </p>
          <p>unsure of what twisted secrets lurked in the shadows or what grotesque specters might rise from the depths of this eerie ocean of decay.</p>

        <section id="novel-text" class="flowInText">
          <p>The silence pressed upon her like an oppressive force, it was far from an absence of events. </p>
          <p>It was a deceptive calm. Every step Alice took sent unsettling echoes through the decaying remnants of twisted vegetation,</p>
          <p> and almost as if in reply, this time echoed back another faint rattle, yet again suppressing itself before long. </p>
          <p>This time seemingly closer, or perhaps just an effect of Alice’s paranoia.</p>

          <p> Rhythmic with her pacing distant rattles persisted every now and then, each one sending a stronger shiver down her spine. </p>
          <p>Still unsure if it was the echo of her own fear or a malevolent presence drawing nearer, she quickened her pace, only to be met with another rattle,</p>
          <p> unmistakably closer this time. Each step Alice took was now accompanied by the haunting percussion of her unseen pursuer. Panic clawing at her mind. </p>

          <p>Finally, after what felt like an eternity of wandering through the twisted forest, they arrived at their destination; the teaparty.</p>

          <p>His twitchy movements and the patchy, ripped, mismatched fabrics of his oversized clothes added to his unsettling appearance.</p>

          <p> “I- I- suppose I could,” She replied.</p>
          <p>Nervously, she took a seat, at last solidifying her place within the teaparty. </p>
