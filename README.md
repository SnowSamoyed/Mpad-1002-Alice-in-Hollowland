Hello! Thank you for taking the time to engage with our interactive story website. Here are a couple of things to note before you get started.

- Upon opening the website, click on the moon to properly launch the site. This will trigger the buttons for chapter selection, autoscroll and full-screen.
- Alice's story has three different endings. Ending 1 (The White Ending) is completed. Ending 2 (The Violet Ending) and Ending 3 (The Red Ending) are prototypes (due to to time constraints and perhaps over-planning, the art was not able to be completed).
- Sound on for the full experience.

A lot of time and love went into Alice in Hollowland. We sincerely hope you enjoy our final project!!
